# NLP-Nucleobase-Sequence-Identification
(2024) A comparison of bag of words, frequency analysis, and brute force in identifying the species from a nucleobase sequence.

## To run the programs:
- In main.py, comment/uncomment 'bow()' 'brute()' and 'zipf()' at the end of the file to select the methods you want to run, then execute it.
- You can modify the 'repeats' global variable to choose how many times each method runs.

## Acknowledgements:
- Nucleobase sequence data was sourced from the NIH GenBank database.
